% This script represents a modification of the MATLAB code developed by Anchukaitis et al. (2020) 
% for the application of the Vaganov-Shashkin model (Vaganov et al. 2006). 
% We modified the original script to provide calculations and results consistent 
% with the implementations of the Vaganov-Shashkin model used in a graphical 
% tool VS-Oscilloscope (Shishov et al. 2016).  Specifically, the script is adjusted to be 
% consistent with the version 1.367 of the Oscilloscope published in March 2021.

% To this end, this script was applied in a following publications:

% 1) Tumajer J., Kaspar J., Kuzelova H., Shishov V.V., Tychkov I.I., Popkova M.I., Vaganov E.A., Treml V. (2021): Forward Modeling Reveals Multidecadal Trends in Cambial Kinetics and Phenology at Treeline. Frontiers in Plant Science 613646.
% 2) Tumajer J., Buras A., Camarero J.J., Carrer M., Shetti R., Wilmking M., Altman J., SangÃ¼esa-Barreda G., Lehejcek J.,: Growing faster, longer or both? Modelling plastic response of Juniperus communis growth phenology to climate change. Submitted to Global Ecology and Biogeography.
% 3) Tumajer J., Shishov V.V., Ilyin V.A., Camarero J.J.: Plastic growth dynamics of Mediterranean pines and junipers determines their climatic adaptability . Submitted to Agricultural and Forest Meteorology.

% The script is presented below as a stand-alone function, which might be called
% as 'vsm_oscilloscope' in MATLAB/Octave. The backbone of this function is a function called
% 'vsm' presented by Anchukaitis et al. (2020) which we altered where necessary. We annotated
% each modification made with ///MODIFICATION/// heading directly above respective altered part of
% the script and provided brief description. The most important modifications are related to 
% soil moisture model and determination of autumn cessation of cambial activity.

% In addition to modifications to the script of 'vsm' function, three small modifications
% have to be made to parameters files:
% 1) New parameter .Vs must be defined (used for determination of growing season cessation)
% 2) New binary parameter .cambial must be defined. If set to 0, cambial block is stoped and simulated TRW chronology is determined based on standardized annual sum of Gr. If set to 1, cambial block is running and two simulated chronologies (based on Gr and cell numbers) are returned
% 3) .Wmin must be set equal to .W1; .Wmax must be set equal to .W4
% The example parameters file for the use of 'vsm_oscilloscope' is provided as 'parameters_oscilloscope'.

% Finaly, the file with function 'NEXT' must be stored in the same folder as 'vsm_oscilloscope' for running of the script.
% It serves for determination of the smooth cessation of the cambial activity in autumn (see line 369 for details).
